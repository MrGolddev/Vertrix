### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
   ```
3. Install required packages
   ```sh
   pip install discord.py
   ```
      ```sh
   pip install discord.py
   ```
         ```sh
   pip install discord.py
   ```
      ```sh
   pip install discord.py
   ```
      ```sh
   pip install discord.py
   ```
         ```sh
   pip install discord.py
   ```
   
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
5. Change git remote url to avoid accidental pushes to base project
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin github_username/repo_name
   git remote -v # confirm the changes
   ```
